# Soil mechanical concepts using Jupyter Notebooks

A set of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various soil mechanical concepts, including

- Grain size distributions
- Soil physical properties
- Principal stresses and Mohr's circle
- Mechanical tests (oedometer, triaxial)
- Active and passive earth pressure
- Slope failure
- Kinematic element methods
- Settlements and consolidation
- Ground failure
- ...


The notebooks mainly make use of

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- ipywidgets
- sympy

The notebooks can be viewed with nbviewer, see https://jupyter.org/, or can now also be run interactively using binder (available through nbviewer).
